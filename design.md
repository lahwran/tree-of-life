- task tree
- multiple children for any node
- root node is "life"
- tasks can depend on other tasks
- priority is a combination of importance and timeframe
- tasks can have a timeframe for when they should be completed
    - something sorta like pivotaltracker's points in that it's easy to pick discrete buckets
- a m
- do we need some sort of "day" main node?
