- multi-writer(!!!)
- non-locking
- transfer data to other nodes as soon as possible
    - when connected, send a diff relative to a hash immediately, along with the hash of the new data
- uses hash history, optionally with hash data for fast fast-forward deltas
    - hash of data, not including parent hash
- consider it a change ONLY WHEN USER-INDUCED! automatically triggered stuff is expected to be the same
    across devices, so don't consider that to be a change


TODO: how long should history be kept before we no longer try to do fast-forwards?
answer: forever until further notice

                period. further timing/ordering guarantees are unnecessary,
                emergent behavior will be correct.

            that's probably fine... maybe powers of two historical data?
            or even screw it and send everything, let the other end figure
            it out

        ** based on the idea that the hashes will be small enough to not
            worry about saving in the first place, just send them. if it
            becomes a bottleneck, perhaps use powers of two optimization?
            (send x[-1], x[-2], x[-4], x[-8], x[-16], x[-32]...)

        TODO: rebroadcast (for 3+ nodes)
        if our current hash is not in the provided hashes:
            reconnect, let connection init fix it
        otherwise:
