x root is a node
|   root has other nodes as children
|
|   nodes are instances of treeoflife.nodes.node.Node, or one
|   of its various subclasses. They have a .children attribute
|   which allows them to contain other nodes.
|
|   root is an instance of treeoflife.nodes.node.TreeRootNode.
|
x tracker is more or less an instance of the treeoflife app;
|   it keeps track of the current root node, and gets to
|   unload/reload it, etc.
|
|   x treeoflife.tracker.Tracker class provides basic load/unload
|   |    and keeping track of a root node
|   |
|   x treeoflife.userinterface.CommandInterface provides
|   |    alarm functionality and simple commandline use
|   |
|   x treeoflife.userinterface.SavingInterface provides
|   |    saving to ~/.treeoflife and committing the internal
|   |    git repository; this class is in charge of autosaving
|   |
|   x treeoflife.main.RemoteInterface provides a few things that
|   |    JSONProtocol needs to work, notably a way to open
|   |    an editor automatically (currently only vim)
|   |
x treeoflife.main.JSONProtocol provides a simple network protocol
|   for communicating with the frontend's javascript code.
|   it provides a way for the frontend to run commands that
|   the CommandInterface class will understand, as well as a
|   way to take a dump of the root node and send it over.
|   
|   There is one instance of JSONProtocol for each open webclient,
|   so if you open a web browser to ui.html at the same time Popup
|   is open, there will be two instances of JSONProtocol.
|
x twisted stuff here - twisted provides 1. a server that hosts
|   ui.html and its resources (ui.less, ui.js, etc)
|   and 2. a network link between JSONProtocol and ui.js.
|

|
x Popup.app (which embeds a webbrowser in the osx menu bar) or 
|    a web browser. Popup.app is a (very heavily) modified version
|    of an example app.
|
x ui.html is loaded from the backend; by default, the backend listens
|    on port 18081 for JSONProtocol connections, 18082 for web
|    connections (go to http://localhost:18082/ for a listing of
|    files, or that url +/ui.html for the webclient) and
|    port 18083 for a websocket interface to JSONProtocol (which
|    is used when you open ui.html outside of popup.app).

|    todo: need a more detailed explanation of the ui code
